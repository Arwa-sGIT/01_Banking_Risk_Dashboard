# Corporate Lending Portfolio: Risk Monitoring & Compliance Dashboard

> **An automated risk intelligence system for corporate banking portfolio managers**
> Built to simulate real-world workflows at top-tier banks.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Corporate Portfolio Managers oversee hundreds of loans worth billions. They face three critical challenges:
1. **Risk Detection**: Identifying payment delays before they escalate.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Tracking KYC (Know Your Customer) renewals.

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| **Portfolio at Risk (PAR)** | % of portfolio with payment delays (DPD > 0) |
| **KYC Compliance Rate** | % of loans with valid KYC documentation |
| **Credit Risk Concentration** | Exposure distribution across sectors |
