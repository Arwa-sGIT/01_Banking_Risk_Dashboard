# Corporate Lending Portfolio: Risk Monitoring & Compliance Dashboard

> **An automated risk intelligence system for corporate banking portfolio managers**
> Built to simulate real-world workflows at top-tier banks.

##  Business Problem
Corporate Portfolio Managers oversee hundreds of loans worth billions. They face three critical challenges:
1. **Risk Detection**: Identifying payment delays before they escalate.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Tracking KYC (Know Your Customer) renewals.
3. **Revenue Growth**: Finding cross-selling opportunities.

**My Solution**: An interactive dashboard providing real-time risk monitoring and compliance alerts.

##  Key Metrics Tracked
| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| **Portfolio at Risk (PAR)** | % of portfolio with payment delays (DPD > 0) |
| **KYC Compliance Rate** | % of loans with valid KYC documentation |
| **Credit Risk Concentration** | Exposure distribution across sectors |

##  Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:

✅ **Business Acumen**: Understanding banking operations and regulatory requirements
✅ **Data Engineering**: Generating realistic synthetic datasets with Python
✅ **Data Visualization**: Designing executive-ready dashboards in Tableau
✅ **Risk Analytics**: Calculating industry-standard KPIs (PAR, DPD, LTV)
✅ **Strategic Thinking**: Translating data insights into actionable recommendations
